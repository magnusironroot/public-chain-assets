# public-chain-assets

This repo holds information about subnet chains that exist on the Avalanche
network.

Each chain in the `chains` folder may contain the following files:
- `chain-information.json`: General information about the chain such as the
  name, vm configuration, and token configuration.
- `token-list.json`: A list of token contracts that exist on the chain with
  information about each. These tokens have been verified using the contract
  verifier at https://subnets.avax.network/tools/verify-contract.
- `gensesis.json`: For chains configured using
  [Subnet EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm), this contains the
  genesis configuration parameters.
- `upgrade.json`: Contains network upgrades for the chain. For more
  information, see 
  https://docs.avax.network/subnets/subnet-upgrade#network-upgrades.
